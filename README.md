# book-cover

Stand-alone web page to generate very simple book covers as 1800x2700 PNGs. Supports title, subtitle, author, colours, fonts, and an optional background image.

Useful if, for example, you're adding a large number of books to Calibre and don't have the time to find decent cover images for them all at once.
